# Programming-Final-Patient-Chart

What I wanted to complete with this project was the ability to have patients/entries written into the system, added, listed, and the ability to save what I've written and added to the file when I exit the program. I also wanted to have an editting feature, but that would have taken much longer for me to write out. 

I wanted to do a charting system to understand what I would be working with in the future. That is far more complex than the code I have written, and it really shows with how long it is. I wouldn't be surprised if I needed 100+ files and 10000+ lines of code to recreate something like that. 

I really liked working on the input portions of the project, and needed a lot of help with the static and void proper usage. 

I learned that this project needed a lot of time to work on, especially with how large I wanted it to be. In the future, a bit more simple would be better, as well as less complex.
